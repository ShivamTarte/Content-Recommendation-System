# LECR Recommendation System - Kaggle Competition Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the LECR Recommendation System project! This repository contains the code and resources used to participate in the Kaggle competition "Learning Equality - Curriculum Recommendations."

The goal of this competition was to develop an accurate and efficient model that matches educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. The provided educational materials are organized into various topic taxonomies and cover a wide range of subjects, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). The challenge was to recommend relevant content items for each topic based on its parent topics.

## Algorithm and Techniques

The Recommendation System is built using the following techniques:

- **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)**: SBERT is a transformer network for calculating cosine sentence similarity. It is used to measure the similarity between topics and content items.

- **Annoy Index**: The Annoy index is utilized to efficiently recommend related content items from a large number of millions of possibilities. This technique has been successfully used by SPOTIFY to recommend songs.

- **Fuzzy Logic**: Fuzzy logic is applied for fine-tuning the recommendations to provide more contextually related content items.

## Data Overview

The project uses five datasets, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Sentence Transformer Dataset**: This dataset contains the sentence embeddings generated by SBERT for the topics and content items.

2. **Competition Topic Dataset**: The dataset contains information about the topic tree branches, their parent topics, and the hierarchy of topics.

3. **Content Dataset**: This dataset comprises educational content items that are linked to specific topics.

4. **Correlation Dataset**: The dataset establishes the relationship between topics and their parent topics, as well as their correlation with content items.

5. **Sample Submission Dataset**: This dataset provides an example of how the final submission should be formatted.

## Usage

To use the LECR Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Download the required datasets from the Kaggle competition link:

   - [Competition Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations/data)
   - [Sentence Transformer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaizen97/sentencetransformers)

2. Preprocess and prepare the datasets using the provided scripts.

3. Run the recommendation system with the main script.
