# Content-Recommendation-System
This is  project named LECR Recommendation system based on kaggle competition i performed and succesfully submitted by using (SBERT)sentence transformer,annoy index and Fuzzy logic.It provided with topics with its parents and content to match to each other.Recommend different contents based on topics.For ex.Trignometry,different content related to it and its parent mathematics will be recommended.

EXPLANATION-The algorithm used is SBERT which is transformer network for cosine sentence similarity.Topics and content are given as input similarity between thm found and relation is formed.Annoy index is used to recommend related contents in from numbers of millions.It is used in SPOTIFY to recommend song and for fine tunining we are fuzzy logic to give related contents

Goal of the Competition-:Learning Equality - Curriculum Recommendations
The goal of this competition is to streamline the process of matching educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. You will develop an accurate and efficient model trained on a library of K-12 educational materials that have been organized into a variety of topic taxonomies.
